      <description>Introduction The manifold hypothesis says that most real-world datasets lie approximately on a low-dimensional manifold, but by some Kantian twist of fate we rarely have direct access to this manifold1. As a result, most machine learning techniques utilize only local structure (e.g. the &amp;ldquo;loss + SGD&amp;rdquo; machine).
In contrast, Topological and Geometric Data Analysis (TGDA) is a burgeoning field that studies the global structure of data. This is exciting not only because of potential domain applications &amp;ndash; it also opens possibilities for porting a lot of powerful and beautiful math to the ML realm.</description>

      <description>And everything else which can be attributed to body presupposes extension, and is only a mode of that which is extended.

 Introduction gh is the official GitHub CLI, maintained in the public cli/cli repository.
Like its predecessor hub1, gh wraps common git commands. But gh does much more, ultimately aiming to be a general GitHub interface for your terminal. You can for example run actions with gh workflow, publish gists with gh gist, or access your codespaces with gh cs.</description>
