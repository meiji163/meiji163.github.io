      <description>Introduction The manifold hypothesis says that most real-world datasets lie approximately on a low-dimensional manifold, but by some Kantian twist of fate we rarely have direct access to this manifold1. As a result, most machine learning techniques utilize only local structure (e.g. the &amp;ldquo;loss + SGD&amp;rdquo; machine).
In contrast, Topological and Geometric Data Analysis (TGDA) is a burgeoning field that studies the global structure of data. This is exciting not only because of potential domain applications &amp;ndash; it also opens possibilities for porting a lot of powerful and beautiful math to the ML realm.</description>

      <title>Liouville&#39;s Theorem on Conformal Rigidity</title>

      <description>In this post I summarize the content and proof of Liouville&amp;rsquo;s Theorem on Conformal Rigidity, which I learned in 2018 from Professor Alex Austin (now at RIT) in his class at UCLA.
Conformal Maps A conformal transformation is one that preserves angles. In two dimensions, this is equivalent to being holomorphic and having a non-vanishing derivative. There are tons of these transformations (my personal favorites are Mobius transformations). In fact, the famous Riemann mapping Theorem asserts that any simply connected domain \( U \subset \mathbb{C} \) admits a bijective conformal map \(f: U \to \mathbb{D}\) to the unit disc.</description>
