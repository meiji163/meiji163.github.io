      <description>In this post I summarize the content and proof of Liouville&amp;rsquo;s Theorem on Conformal Rigidity, which I learned in 2018 from Professor Alex Austin (now at RIT) in his class at UCLA.
Conformal Maps A conformal transformation is one that preserves angles. In two dimensions, this is equivalent to being holomorphic and having a non-vanishing derivative. There are tons of these transformations (my personal favorites are Mobius transformations). In fact, the famous Riemann mapping Theorem asserts that any simply connected domain $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ admits a bijective conformal map $f: U \to \mathbb{D}$ to the unit disc.</description>
