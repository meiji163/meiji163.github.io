      <description>In this post I go over the basics of data compression with arithmetic coding and describe the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. At the end I discuss implementation and some experimental results.
Information Theory Review First a quick review of information theory. Suppose that we receive some data $x$ drawn from a discrete random variable $X$, whose probability distribution is $P$. Then the Shannon information content of $x$ is defined as</description>

      <description>In this post I show how writing primes as the sum of two squares is related to factoring Gaussian integers. I then describe an algorithm to compute the sum of two squares representation.
Gaussian Integers I have a special penchant for Gaussian integers because they are the first ring I learned about (besides the regular integers of course). Mathematically, they are the set of complex numbers $a+bi$ with $a,b$ integers, and they are denoted as $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.</description>
