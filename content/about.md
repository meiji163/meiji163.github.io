HI I'm meiji163. I currently work on databases at GitHub.
Fun fact: 163 is the largest [Heegner number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heegner_number)!


Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/meiji163) and [Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0).
If anyone needs me I'll be in _the Chamber of Understanding_!
